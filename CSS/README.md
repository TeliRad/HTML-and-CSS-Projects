# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
 AOLCC 
This file will contain all projects from my HTML and CSS course
In this folder I have created a Portfolio Website in HTML then updated it in CSS. 
I have learnt how to add color, change font size and create menus and automation. 
I have also learnt how easy it is to create code with Bootstrap.
